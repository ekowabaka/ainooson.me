    <p>I am a PhD. candidate working under <a href="https://my.vanderbilt.edu/mkunda">Dr. Maithilee Kunda</a> at the [[https://my.vanderbilt.edu/aivaslab|Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence and Visual Analogical Systems]] of the [[https://vanderbilt.edu|Vanderbilt University]]. My current research involves applying Program Synthesis as a tool for modeling strategy differences in intelligent systems. Primarily, I study tasks in the domain of visuo-spatial reasoning with models that use visual imagery as a core knowledge representation.</p>

    <p> Before starting work on my PhD, I obtained a BSc in Computer Engineering from the [[https://www.ug.edu.gh|University of Ghana]], after which I worked with the [[https://nthc.com.gh|National Trust Holding Company]], and briefly with [[https://hubtel.com|SMSGH]] (now Hubtel).</p>
